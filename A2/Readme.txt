1. Please run the "createDB.sql" file first to create the databases;
2. The username of the database is "root" and the password is blank.
3. We have created below default accounts:
username pwd role
trail1   1   ORDER
trail2   2   IT(inventory)
trail3   3   SHIPPING
4. Our system implements role-based access, meaning only users that have a "ORDER" role can access the order view.
